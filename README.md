Dashboard â€“ App

# Used React | JSX | CSS to complete the code 
# Used D3 library for chart and card visuals
# The structure of the App is 
- Created 3 components
* Table Visual
* Bar Chart Visual
* Card Visual â€“ 4 Cards
used Props Drilling to communicate between Parent Child Component
Used Hooks and functional component to write the code 	
- useRef, useState, useEffect
#used babel-loader for transpile 
# Used webpack bundler
# the package doesnt not contain the node_modules needs to be installed to test the code (npm install or yarn)


# about the Features
# completed most of the it but not able to do cross filtering from card visual and bar Chart
# added filters for filtering in the page
# table visual can be used for cross-filtering
# Given more time can finish the cross-filtering features for all visuals
# To enable cross-Filtering for table I used map function to work with parent and the child
# Same logic was not applicable for Bar chart and Card since I have SVG (d3) model more graph structure
# So I would take more time to finish cross-filter for other visual 
# also completed power BI visual which Im experience and good for dashboard development.
