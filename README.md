# React | JSX | CSS 
# D3 library for chart and card visuals
# App structure: 
- Created 3 components
* Table Visual
* Bar Chart Visual
* Card Visual â€“ 4 Cards
used Props Drilling to communicate between Parent Child Components
Used Hooks and functional component to write the code 	
- useRef, useState, useEffect
- used babel-loader for transpile 
- Used webpack for bundler

# about the Features
- completed most of the it but not able to do cross filtering from card visual and bar Chart
- added filters for filtering in the page
- table visual can be used for cross-filtering
- Given more time I can finish the cross-filtering features for all visuals
- To enable cross-Filtering for table I used map function to work with parent and the child
- Same logic was not applicable for Bar chart and Card since I have SVG (d3) model more graph structure
- So I would take more time to finish cross-filter for other visual 
- also completed power BI visual which Im experience and good for dashboard development.
- The Power BI file attached in the mail and works if you installed in the PC
